				Now you can drink WHAT you want, WHEN you want,WHERE you want, with no hassles and 
				for less money!
 				What more could you ask for? Now you can drink your favorite beverage at the movies, 
 				the ballgame, 
 				wine and cheese parties, you decide.Just think of the possibilities:
		 		Your favorite brew at the ball game instead of what they happened to be serving at 
		 		seven bucks a pop. 
		 		The savings at just one game will pay for your Beerbelly!
		 		<br/>
		 		Turn an A cup in to double Ds and sport your favorite beverage for yourself and
		 		 your friends. Better than a Boob Job and Cheaper Too. Not to mention the savings 
		 		 on over priced drinks. We developed The WineRack to Fill Out our product line if you will. 
		 		 The picture shown here is of our good friend Drea, who is not, no offense Drea, Well Endowed. 
		 		 Sporting the WineRack and Voila’ Drea’s giving Pamela Anderson a run for the money. 
		 		 Take a bottle of wine, a mixed drink or even a fifth of your favorite hard stuff to the movies, 
		 		 concerts, ball games, even PTA meetings.
